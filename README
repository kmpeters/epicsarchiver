This is PV_Archive.py, a system for recording Epics PV data 
to a MySQL database and for viewing data from the database
using a web interface.  The system has been designed for the
Linux/Apache/MySQL/Python set of tools and requires:

  - apache webserver:  Apache 2.X at least

  - python: version 2.3 or higher

  - mysql: MySQL 5.x (with INNOdb support)  For many linux
           distributions, you will need the 'devel' package.
  
These are generally standard components on modern linux machines.
You will also need these (slightly less standard) tools:

  - Gnuplot  4.0 or higher

  - Epics Base.

  - mod_python.  Many linux distributions include this as an
    add-on package for Apache.  The source for this is included, 
    but you will need to install this and configure apache to use it. 

  - These python modules (included in the source install):
        Gnuplot : py_install/gnuplot-py-1.7.tar.gz
        MySQLdb : py_install/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz
        PyEpics : py_install/pyepics3.0.9.tar.gz

    All of these packages buid and install with a simple
        python setup.py install
    For MySQLdb, you may need the 'mysql-devel' package installed.
    For PyEpics, you need a minimal installation of Epics base.

See INSTALL for more Installation instructions.

See doc/ApacheConfig.txt for more details on setting up Apache and mod_python.
