This is PV_Archive.py, a system for recording Epics PV data 
to a MySQL database and for viewing data from the database
using a web interface.  The system has been designed for the
Linux/Apache/MySQL/Python set of tools and requires:

  - apache webserver:  Apache 2.X at least

  - python: version 2.3 or higher

  - mysql:  MySQL 5.x (with INNOdb support)
  
These are generally standard components on modern linux machines.
You will also need these (slightly less standard) tools:

  - Gnuplot  4.0 or higher

  - These python modules (included in the source install):
      python-MySQLdb
      python-gnuplot
 
  - mod_python.  The source for this is included, but you will 
    need to install this AND configure apache to use it.
