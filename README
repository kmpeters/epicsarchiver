This is the Epics PV Archiver, a system for recording Epics PV data to a
MySQL database and for viewing data from the database using a web
interface.  

The system has been designed for the Linux/Apache/MySQL/Python set of tools
and requires the following components:

  - apache webserver:  Apache 2.X at least.

  - python: version 2.5 or higher.  

  - mysql: MySQL 5.x, with INNOdb support.  For many linux
           distributions, you will need the 'devel' package.
  
  - Gnuplot  4.0 or higher

  - mod_python.  Many linux distributions include this as an
    add-on package for Apache.  The source for this is included, 
    but you will need to install this and configure apache to use it. 

  - Epics Base.  You'll want Epics base 3.14.9 or higher.

  - Gnuplot Python module (py_install/gnuplot-py-1.7.tar.gz)

  - MySQLdb Python module. (py_install/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz)

      Many systems have a package for this.  If you use such a package, 
      make sure you also install the 'mysql-devel' package.

  - Epics Python module : (py_install/pyepics3.0.10.tar.gz)
