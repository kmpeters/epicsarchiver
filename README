This is PV_Archive.py, a system for recording Epics PV data 
to a MySQL database and for viewing data from the database
using a web interface.  The system has been designed for the
Linux/Apache/MySQL/Python set of tools and requires:

  - apache webserver:  Apache 2.X at least

  - python: version 2.3 or higher

  - mysql:  MySQL 5.x (with INNOdb support)
  
  - a minimal Epics installation (at least epics base).

These are generally standard components on modern linux machines.
You will also need these (slightly less standard) tools:

  - Epics Base.

  - Gnuplot  4.0 or higher

  - These python modules (included in the source install):
      MySQLdb : py_install/MySQL-python-1.2.2.tar.gz
      Gnuplot : py_install/gnuplot-py-1.7.tar.gz
      EpicsCA : py_install/EpicsCA-2.0.7.tar.gz

  - mod_python.  The source for this is included, but you will 
    need to install this and configure apache to use it.

See INSTALL for more Installation instructions.

See doc/ApacheConfig.txt for more details on setting up Apache and mod_python.

See doc/Usage.txt for general usage notes, 

See doc/WebPages.txt for detailed notes on how to build and 
    view web pages of PVs.

See doc/DataLayout.txt for description of MySQL databases,
    and command-line tools for extracting data.
