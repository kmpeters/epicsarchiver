General installation instructions for the EpicsArchiver:

The end result will be: 
   1. pvarch : a command line program for interacting
             with the data collection / archiving
   2. mysql tables holding the data
   3. a directory of web scripts to access the data:    
        a) a 'plotting' page for plotting the history
           of archived values.
        b) a 'status' page, showing current values
           of PVs, with links to the plotting page.

   4. a directory of web-page templates for the 
      the status page.
   

== Quick Installation Instructions ===

 0. Install Epics base, Apache, Python, MySQL, and Gnuplot.   
    For all except Epics base, these are all standard 
    components on modern linux systems, and you should not
    need custom installations.

 1. Install mod_python.

 2. Install python extensions for EpicsCA, Gnuplot, MySQL.

 3. Set up MySQL permissions for a privileged account that can
    grant permissions.

 4. edit the settings in config.py

 5. run 'python setup.py install'

 6. Configure Apache to use mod_python for the web programs

 7.  Initialize the MySQL databases with 'bin/init_pvarch'

 8. Add some PVs to be collected.

 9. Start data collection.

10. View / Modify web page templates

11. Set up cron scripts to manage databases

12. Continue to add PVs and/or modify web pages

============================================================

Detailed instructions:

== 0. Install Epics base, Apache, Python, MySQL, and Gnuplot.   
   
For Epics, only epics base is needed. Use R3.14.8 or higher:

   mkdir /usr/local/epics
   cd    /usr/local/epics
   wget http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/download/base/baseR3.14.9.tar.gz
   tar xvzf baseR3.14.9.tar.gz
   cd base-3.14.9/
   make 
   cd .. 
   ln -s base-3.14.9 base

For Python, MySQL, and Gnuplot, standard linux packages will work.

Apache should also work from standard linux packages, though there 
seem to be some variations in layout between distributions.   You
may have to learn a little about the Apache configuration on your
machine.  You will need Apache with 'APXS' for loading mod_python

==  1. Install mod_python

A linux package for mod_python ought to work, but you may need to build
from source too.   It's straightforward, but you'll need to know
some details about Apache, especially where 'apxs' is.
 
== 2. Install python extensions for EpicsCA, Gnuplot, MySQL. 

These all install with 'python setup.py install'.  The python
packages are in py_install.   

The EpicsCA installation will need to find EPICS base, so if it is
somewhere other than /usr/local/epics/base, you may need to set the
environmental variable EPICS_BASE.

 
== 3. Set up MySQL permissions for a privileged account that can
      grant permissions.

That is, set up a mysql super-user account:
   ~> mysql 
    mysql> grant all privileges on *.* to me@localhost identified by 'me';

You will need to use this username/password to set up the databases
for the archiver

== 4. edit the settings in config.py

There are many setting in config.py, mostly which has further instructions 
for what they mean.   You will need to edit these to reflect your set up.

== 5. run 'python setup.py install'

This installs the initial set up of python code, the program 'pvarch', the
web scripts, and initial web template files.... you're close!!

== 6. Configure Apache to use mod_python for the web programs

Doing 'python setup.py install'  wrote the file httpd_pvarch.conf

This should go into Apache's configuration, and apache should be restarted.

== 7.  Initialize the MySQL databases with 'bin/init_pvarch'

This will create the initial databases for archiving.  You will be prompted 
for the 'super-user' username/password from Step 3.   

Note that running this will wipe out any previous archiving databases, so
you really only need to run this once.

== 8. Add some PVs to be collected.

Use the 'pvarch' program to add individual PVs or a file listing PVs:
   ~>pvarch add_pv      'XXX.VAL'
   ~>pvarch add_pvfile  'PvList.txt'

PvList.txt lists PVs to be added, one or more (comma separated) per line.

== 9. Start data collection.

Start both the caching and archiving processes:
   ~>pvarch cache start

   ~>pvarch start

This creates 2 processes:
   'cacher'  : connects to Epics PVs and caches their current
               values into a database
   'archiver': reads the cached values and archives.


== 10. View / Modify web page templates

You can view the status of 'cached' PVs with the cgi-bin/status.py 
web script (the URL being set from config.py).

The PVs shown are determined by the web template files (which are
copied from the templates/ directory at installation to the final
destination set in config.py).

Editing these templates will change what is shown on the status pages.

See the README in the template directory for more details.

== 11. Set up cron scripts to manage databases

You may want to check the status of the cache and archiver periodically,
and rotate archive databases.  The scripts in cron/ give some examples
of this.

== 12. Continue to add PVs and/or modify web pages

Note that once the web pages are working, adding PVs to a template file 
will add it to the cache and archive as soon as the page is accessed.
When running, this is often the easiest way to add a PV to the archive.
