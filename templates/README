This directory holds the Template Files to auto-generate the web pages for
the Epics PV Archiver.

Each template file can list many PVs, typically grouped logically, and will
be shown as a separate 'Notebook Tab' in the status page, with the pages title.
The template format for each of these template files is detailed below.

Ordering of Pages / Overall Structure
-------------------------------------

The file 'FileList' in this directory contains the list of  
Title, Template File pairs: 
  
    Storage Ring | storage_ring.txt
    Vacuum System | vacuum.txt

etc (separated by '|').   This will determine what notebook tabs
are shown in the status page; in this case 'Storage Ring' and 
'Vacuum System'.

When FileList changes, you must run 'make' which will automatically
generate pages.py which is actually used by the web scripts.

You do NOT need to run make when you change a template file -- these 
are read on the fly.


Template Formating:
-------------------

The status pages contain an HTML table, with each row corresponding 
to one or more Epics PVs.

The general idea is to list the PV(s) to be shown.

A simple example would be:


   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL

This will generally get mapped to a table row that has
   Description   ||    Current_Value_with_Link_to_Archive

The descripton is usually automatically found, but can be explicitly set 
by separating with a '|':

   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL | Ring Current

In addition, the formatting can be explicitly set as well:

   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL | Ring Current | %.2f


For ENUM PVs, the ENUM string will be shown as the Current_Value, but it's 
not uncommon for integer PVs to hold a 'status' field with values '0' and
'1'.  For these, there is a special 'yes/no' format that can be used to
write 'No' if the value is 0,  'Yes' if the value is 1, and 'Unknown'
otherwise. (This works for 'Stations Searched' PVs at the APS!)

To specify the formatting but use the default description, use
   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL | | %.2f


You can put multiple PVs on a single line, separated by commas:

   XXX:m1.VAL, XXX:m2.VAL

Which will list many PVs on a single line.  You'll probably want to 
set the description explicitly:
  
   XXX:m1.VAL, XXX:m2.VAL | Sample Motors (chi, theta)

You can write a title line in red with '[Title]', and a horizontal rule 
with '----', and an empty row with '<>'

 
More examples are provided in the files 'GSE_pageN.txt'


And, again, the template files can be edited 'on-the-fly'.
