This documents the layout of Databases and Tables for 
the Epics Archiver. 

There are two databases used for status information: the
master_database, and the cache_database.  In addition, there will
be a series of data archives, each containing historical data for
a given time period.

The master_database contains the following tables:

    current: Current Status for Archiving Process
        status    status of archiving process 
                  (one of 'offline','running','stopping','unknown')
        db        name of active 'data archive'
        pid       PID for archiving process.

    pairs:  Table of Pair Scores for Related PVs
        pv1       name of pv #1
        pv2       name of pv #2
        score     The pair score for pvs #1 and #2

    runs:  History of Data Archives
        id          index
        db          name of archive database
        notes       human readable time range
        start_time  starting timestamp for database
        stop_time   ending timestamp for database

The cache_database contains the following tables:

    info: Status information for the Caching Process
        id        index
        ts        timestamp of last insert
        datetime  human readable time of last insert
        pid       PID for caching process

    cache: Store of current PV values
        id        index
        name      PV name
        type      PV data type
        value     most recent value for PV
        cvalue    string representation of PV value
        ts        timestamp of last update

    req: Request for adding PVs to cache
        id       index
        name     name of PV requested to be added to cache.

Each of the Data tables will have the following tables:
 
    pv:  Information about PVs
        id          index for PV
        name        PV name
        active      whether archiving is active ('yes','no')
        data_table  name of data table

        description description for PV
        deadtime    deadtime for PV inserts
        deadband    deadband for PV inserts
        graph_hi    upper limit for graphing
        graph_lo    lower limit for graphing
        graph_type  one of ('normal','log','discrete') to control
                    what sort of graph to make
        type        data type for PV

    pvdat001:  The data archives: there are 128 of these tables.
    pvdat002:  The 'data_table' entry for each PV points to
    pvdat003:  which table is used for that PV.  Since there
     .         may be >> 128 PVs, these tables will hold data 
      .        for many PVs, but data lookups are easily reduced 
       .       to one of the 128 tables.
    pvdat128: 
       time         timestamp for value
       pv_id        PV id (ie, from pv table)
       value        value for PV=pv_id at Time=time
