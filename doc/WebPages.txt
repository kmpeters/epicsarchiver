The Web status pages are automatically generated from the template files 
in the 'web template directory'.

Each template file can list many PVs, typically grouped logically, and will
be shown as a separate 'Notebook Tab' in the status page, with the pages title.
The template format for each of these template files is detailed below.

Ordering of Pages / Overall Structure
-------------------------------------

The master file 'FileList' in the template directory contains the 
list of Title, Template File pairs: 
  
    Storage Ring | storage_ring.txt
    Vacuum System | vacuum.txt

etc (separated by '|') that will be used to make the 'Notebook Tabs'
on the status page, in this case, there will be two tabs: 'Storage Ring' 
and 'Vacuum System'.

To add or change the Tab titles or template files, alter FileList and
run 'make'.  This will generate pages.py which is actually loaded by the 
web scripts.

You do NOT need to run 'make; when you change a template file -- these are 
read on the fly.


Template Formating:
-------------------

The status pages contain an HTML table, with each row corresponding to one
or more Epics PVs.

The general idea is to list the PV(s) to be shown.

A simple example would be:


   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL

This will generally get mapped to a table row that has
   Description                 Current_Value_with_Link_to_Archive

The descripton shown can be found automatically from the PVs description
field (if available), but can be explicitly set by separating with a '|':

   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL | Ring Current

In addition, the formatting can be explicitly set as well:

   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL | Ring Current | %.2f


For ENUM PVs, the ENUM string will be shown as the Current_Value, but it's 
not uncommon for integer PVs to hold a 'status' field with values '0' and
'1'.  For these, there is a special 'yes/no' format that can be used to
write 'No' if the value is 0,  'Yes' if the value is 1, and 'Unknown'
otherwise. (This works for 'Stations Searched' PVs at the APS!)

To specify the formatting but use the default description, use
   S:SRCurrentAI.VAL | | %.2f


You can put multiple PVs on a single line, separated by commas:

   XXX:m1.VAL, XXX:m2.VAL

Which will list many PVs on a single line.  You'll probably want to 
set the description explicitly:
  
   XXX:m1.VAL, XXX:m2.VAL | Sample Motors (chi, theta)

You can write a title line in red with '[Title]', and a horizontal rule 
with '----', and an empty row with '<>'

 
Several examples are provided in the files 'GSE_pageN.txt'

And, again, the template files can be edited 'on-the-fly'.
