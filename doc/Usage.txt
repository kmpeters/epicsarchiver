This describes general usage of the pvarch program
to control the PVarchiving processes.

pvarch takes the following arguments:

  pvarch help     
     shows a list of commands  
 
  pvarch status
     shows a brief report indicating whether the
     archiving is running, and how many recent
     inserts there have been
               
  pvarch check
     returns simply the number of archived PVs
     in the past 10 minutes.  This can be used
     effectively in scripts to detect problems.

  pvarch start 
     start the archiving process

  pvarch stop
     stop archiving

  pvarch restart
     force a restart of the archiving process
                 
  pvarch next
     rotate the archive database to the next
     sequential database -- this is recommended
     periodically to keep each 'archive run' 
     reasonably small.  Note that data retrieval
     will automatically access multiple archives
     if needed.
    
  pvarch add_pv
  pvarch add_pvfile

  pvarch drop_pv

  pvarch cache start
  pvarch cache stop
  pvarch cache restart
  pvarch cache status
  pvarch cache activity
